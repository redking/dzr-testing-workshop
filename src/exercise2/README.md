# Exercise 2 - React Components

## Description

When you run `npm start` you'll see the same App from exercise 1, with the following differences

1. The React component uses state to populate the result field
2. If the result is greater than zero, the field is colored green. A negative result
will turn the field red. A zero result will leave the input field at the default background color.

## Prerequisites

1. If `npm test` or `npm start` is running, close it with `ctrl - C`
2. Rename the file `src/exercise2/App.testtodo.js` to `src/exercise2/App.test.js`
3. Open the file `src/index.js` and rename the import on line 3 to `exercise2/App`

## Task

In this exercise you'll be writing tests for a simple React component.

- Launch Jest with the command `npm test`.
- Open the file `src/exercise2/App.test.js` and implement the empty tests.
- Some of the tests should fail. Modify `exercise2/App.js` to pass the tests
