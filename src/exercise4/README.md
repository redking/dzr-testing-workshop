# Exercise 4 - Calls to the server

## Description

In this exercise, we wrap the app from exercise 2, adding a button that changes
the color of the site header.

This change occurs upon click with a delay of 100ms i.e. it is asynchronous

## Prerequisites

1. If `npm test` or `npm start` is running, close it with `ctrl - C`
2. Rename the file `src/exercise4/App.testtodo.js` to `src/exercise4/App.test.js`
3. Open the file `src/index.js` and rename the import on line 3 to `exercise4/App`
4. Open a new console window and launch the command `node server.js` from the root of this project

## Task

In this exercise you'll be writing tests for code that calls a server

- Launch Jest with the command `npm test`.
- Open the file `src/exercise4/App.test.js` and implement the empty tests.
- Some of the tests should fail. Modify `exercise4/App.js` to pass the tests
